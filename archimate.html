		<h1>ArchiMate Ontology</h1>
	</div>
	<p>This is the namespace for ArchiMate 3.2, an open and independent enterprise architecture modeling language maintained by The Open Group.</p>
	
	<h2>Available Formats</h2>
	<p>The ArchiMate ontology is available in multiple machine-readable and human-readable formats:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>HTML Documentation:</strong> <a href="https://purl.org/archimate">https://purl.org/archimate</a> (this page) - Human-readable reference guide</li>
		<li><strong>OWL Ontology:</strong> <a href="https://purl.org/archimate/owl">https://purl.org/archimate/owl</a> - Formal ontology for reasoning, inference, and semantic web applications</li>
		<li><strong>SKOS Vocabulary:</strong> <a href="https://purl.org/archimate/skos">https://purl.org/archimate/skos</a> - Controlled vocabulary for taxonomy, classification, and content management systems</li>
	</ul>
	<p><em>Note:</em> Legacy URL <code>https://purl.org/archimate/rdf</code> redirects to the OWL ontology for backwards compatibility.</p>
	
	<h2>Namespace Declaration</h2>
	<p>When using ArchiMate in RDF/OWL, declare the namespace as follows:</p>
