### SHACL Validation: Business Layer Valid Relationship Combinations
### ArchiMate 3.2 Specification - Appendix B Relationship Matrix
###
### Elements in this file:
###   BusinessActor, BusinessRole, BusinessCollaboration, BusinessInterface,
###   BusinessProcess, BusinessFunction, BusinessService, BusinessInteraction,
###   BusinessEvent, BusinessObject, BusinessContract, Representation, Product
###
### Relationship codes:
###   a=access, c=composition, f=flow, g=aggregation, i=assignment,
###   n=influence, o=association, r=realization, s=specialization,
###   t=triggering, v=serving
###
### Generated from relationships.xml matrix
###
### owl:imports note:
### The ontology declares @base <https://purl.org/archimate#> so its IRI is
### <https://purl.org/archimate#>. We import <https://purl.org/archimate/owl>
### which is the PURL that redirects to the raw Turtle file. These URIs differ
### but engines resolve owl:imports by dereferencing the URL, so the import
### works. purl.org does not support content negotiation (Accept headers) —
### separate PURLs are used for each representation (/archimate → SKOS HTML,
### /archimate/owl → OWL Turtle).
