### SHACL Validation: Physical Layer — Composition, Aggregation, Access, Realization
### ArchiMate 3.2 Specification — Appendix B Relationship Matrix
###
### Elements:
###   Active Structure: Equipment, Facility, DistributionNetwork
###   Passive Structure: Material
###
### Relationship types validated here:
###   c=composition, g=aggregation, a=access, r=realization
###
### Excluded (covered by Levels 1 & 2):
###   flow, triggering, serving  → Level 2 §1 Generic Metamodel
###   association                → universally permissive
###   specialization             → Level 1 §3 same-type constraint
###   influence                  → Level 2 §7 Motivation Metamodel
###   assignment                 → Level 2 §§1-2
###
### Note: Physical layer has no behavior elements — all behavior is inherited from
### Technology layer per spec Section 8.3.

### Derived from relationships.xml
